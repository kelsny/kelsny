#### [I'm a TypeScript main, JavaScript needs a buff, sometimes I play Rust, Python and even Java.](https://cursorsdottsx.github.io/)

I know a few languages well enough, but I mainly excel in Java/JavaScript/Python.

Sometimes I like to dip my toes into systems programming with Rust or even C++.

I have a great interest in physics and geometry (primarily linear algebra), and computer graphics.

Of course, computer graphics requires lots of mathematics, most of which I don't know yet (what the hell is a wedge product and bivector???),
so currently I'm studying other, easier, more intuitive fields of computer science (and of course, the math needed to render a freaking cube).

Currently I am studying - Computer Science: Compilers and interpreters

**Finally nearing two years of programming :tada:**

Interested in how I create things out of only TypeScript types? [How to TypeScript](https://cursorsdottsx.github.io/how-to-typescript) is your source.
