### Hi, I am \[Cursors\]

[**I'm a fullstack developer who mains in TypeScript!**](https://cursorsdottsx.github.io/)

I can be found on Discord as `[Cursors]#9257` and sometimes I even pop onto Reddit for a while (`u/CursorsDev`)

I'm pretty much addicted to TypeScript, as you can tell from the stats below:

![My Languages](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=cursorsdottsx&layout=compact&theme=dark)

I know a few languages well enough, but I mainly excel in Java/JavaScript/Python.

Sometimes I like to dip my toes into systems programming with Rust or even C++.

I have a great interest in physics and geometry (primarily linear algebra), and currently use it to pursue computer graphics!

Currently I am participating in Google's [Foobar challenge](https://foobar.withgoogle.com/).
