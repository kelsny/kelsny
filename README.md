### Hi, I am \[Cursors\]!

#### [I'm a TypeScript main, JavaScript needs a buff, sometimes I play Rust, Python and even Java. But most of the time, I'm making c̴̼͛u̶͚͆r̵̲͠s̵̼̈́e̷̻̿d̸̖͝ ̴̪̿t̸̫̏h̴͍̒i̴̡̍n̵̟̎g̶̺͐s̵̗̑.](https://cursorsdottsx.github.io/)

I can be found on Discord as `[Cursors]#9257` and sometimes I even pop onto Reddit for a while (`u/CursorsDev`)

I'm pretty much addicted to TypeScript, as you can tell from the stats below:

![My Languages](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=cursorsdottsx&layout=compact&theme=dark)

I know a few languages well enough, but I mainly excel in Java/JavaScript/Python.

But sometimes I like to dip my toes into systems programming with Rust or even C++.

I have a great interest in physics and geometry (primarily linear algebra), and currently use it to pursue computer graphics!

Of course, computer graphics requires lots of mathematics, most of which I don't know yet (what the hell is a wedge product and bivector???),
so currently I'm studying other, easier, more intuitive fields of computer science (and of course, the math needed to render a freaking cube).

Currently I am studying - Computer Science: Compilers and interpreters

**Finally nearing two years of programming :tada:**

Interested in how I create things out of only TypeScript types? [How to TypeScript](https://cursorsdottsx.github.io/how-to-typescript) is your source.
